They provide comfortable rooms, vegetarian food options, and are family-friendly. Prices for a standard double room typically range from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 1500 per night.\n\nIt's always a good idea to check online reviews, compare prices, and book in advance to secure the best deals.

It's recommended to book your tickets in advance to secure the best prices. Prices can vary depending on the time of booking, seasonality, and demand, but you can expect to find fares starting from around ₹3,000 to ₹5,000 for a one-way ticket.\n\nRemember to factor in the cost of ground transportation from Mangalore to Coorg when planning your overall budget for the trip."
